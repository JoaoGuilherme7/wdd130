                    White Water Rafting was founded in 1995 by John and Mary Smith. The couple had always been
                    passionate about the outdoors and wanted to share their love of nature with others. They started the
                    company with just a few rafts and a dream of providing unforgettable experiences for their
                    customers. Over the years, White Water Rafting has grown into one of the premier outdoor adventure
                    companies in the country, offering trips on some of the most scenic rivers in the world.
