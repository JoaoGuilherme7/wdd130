            Hello! I'm JoÃ£o Guilherme, a <i>Flamenguista</i> from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. At the moment I'm writing this I am 24 years old.
            <br> As a typical Brazilian guy, the sport I like the most is Soccer and this is my hobby as well, both playing and watching.
            <br>I also like to watch movies and series and swimming under waterfalls.
            (If you visit me I'll probably take you to one since we have plenty of them in my region.)</p>

        <p>My state is known for its beautiful beaches and the capital. But I actually live in the montains, which have their beautiful spots as well.</p>
